**Problem Statement**
When you’re trying to stay fit or track macros, one of the hardest parts is visibility. You can see your food — but you can’t easily quantify what’s inside it. This makes it hard to:
- Track your daily protein or calorie intake accurately.
- Stick to a diet plan made by your nutritionist or trainer.
- Make informed food decisions on the go.

**Target Persona**
This MVP is designed for:
- Health-conscious individuals trying to maintain a balanced diet.
- Fitness enthusiasts tracking macros.
- Anyone who wants quick nutritional insights without manual logging.

**This AI-powered app:**
- Lets you upload a food image.
- Uses an LLM (Llama 3 model) to analyze and estimate nutritional content.
- Displays results in a clean, human-readable format.

**Tech Stack**
We built the MVP using below tech stack:
- Frontend: Streamlit (for rapid prototyping)
- Framework: LangChain (for LLM orchestration)
- LLM: Groq API with Llama 3
- Monitoring: LangSmith (for tracing and evaluation)
- Language: Python
